# Professional Operations Specification

## Purpose

This spec covers repository hygiene, continuous integration, dependency maintenance, and operational documentation required to run IA Inversiones as a professional project.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Reviewable Operational Documentation

The repository MUST document how contributors verify, secure, and operate the project without exposing secrets.

#### Scenario: New contributor onboarding

- GIVEN a contributor opens the repository
- WHEN they read the root documentation
- THEN they can find setup, test, security, and contribution guidance
- AND they can identify which commands are local-only versus production-connected

### Requirement: Pull Request Quality Gates

The repository MUST provide CI checks that validate backend tests and frontend build quality without requiring production Supabase secrets.

#### Scenario: Pull request validation

- GIVEN a pull request changes code
- WHEN GitHub Actions runs CI
- THEN Python tests run without production secrets
- AND frontend lint/build checks run independently of operational jobs

### Requirement: Dependency Maintenance Visibility

The repository SHOULD surface dependency updates for Python, npm, and GitHub Actions.

#### Scenario: Dependency update availability

- GIVEN upstream dependencies release updates
- WHEN scheduled maintenance checks run
- THEN the repository receives grouped update proposals or alerts
- AND maintainers can review them without manual package scanning
